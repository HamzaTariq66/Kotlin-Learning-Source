    why we use nested classes:

    There are several reasons for using nested classes, among them:

    1. It is a way of logically grouping classes that are only used in one place.
    2. It increases encapsulation.
    3. Nested classes can lead to more readable and maintainable code.
    4. Child to parent class connection is simpler as it visually illustrates the variables and methods of each
       class.
