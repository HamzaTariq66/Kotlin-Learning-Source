    what is  MOdule :

    Module can be a bunch of kotlin Files or some other files .
    such as a module can be a IntelliJ IDEA.
   module can be a Groove
   module Mavn and so On.


    Visibility modifiers are keywords that set the visibility (accessibility) of classes, objects, interface,
    constructors, functions, properties and their setters. (You cannot set visibility modifier of getters as
    they always take the same visibility as that of the property.)


    kotlin Supports:
    .public
    .protected
    .private
    .internal

    Visibility Modifiers Inside Package :-

    public	   :  declarations are visible everywhere
    private	   :  visible inside the file containing the declaration
    internal   :  visible inside the same module (a set of Kotlin files compiled together)
    protected  :  not available for packages (used for subclasses)

    Visibility Modifiers Inside Classes and Interfaces :-

    public	   :  visible to any client who can see the declaring class
    private    :  visible inside the class only
    protected  :  visible inside the class and its subclasses (Not for any other class).
    internal   :  visible to any client inside the module that can see the declaring class
