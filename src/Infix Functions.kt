    -->Infix Function:

    Using Infix function we can actually use english like text where you can say a1 plus a2.
    instead of using a1.plus(a2) we can say a1 plus a2.

                                            OR

     Kotlin allows some functions to be called without using the period and brackets. These are called infix
     methods,and their use can result in code that looks much more like a natural language.

    -->Operator Overloading:

    OO is a specific case of polymorphism, where different operators have different
    implementations depending on their arguments.

   -->Polymorphism :

    . Polymorphism is a OOPs concept where one name can have many forms.

    For example, you have a smartphone for communication. The communication mode you choose could be
    anything. It can be a call, a text message, a picture message, mail, etc. So, the goal is common that
    is communication, but their approach is different. This is called Polymorphism.
